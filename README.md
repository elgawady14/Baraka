 * `SDWebImage` is an async image downloader with cache support. 

WHY did I use? 
1. I can use with it an activity indicator to show the status of downloading the images which improves the app user experience.
2. Easy to integrate in code for example I use it on an extension of type `UIImageView` and it can also be used on other controls like UIButton,..
3. It can be used as an async image downloader and to cache images in memory or it can only be used as an async image downloader. 
4. So popular and has so good rating/stars on Github which means it'll be updated to date with Apple new OS updates continuously.
3. Accurate memeory caching for images.
